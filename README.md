# order_form
My try on the order_form frontend exercise (https://github.com/rstacruz/frontend-exercises/tree/master/order-form) using AngularJS (v1.6.3). It will detect VISA, MasterCard and AmericanExpress card and check for their validity.

# usage
Open (https://vantezzen.github.io/order_form/) and type in a credit card number ([Click here to get demo credit card numbers](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_AU/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/credit_card_numbers.htm))

# credit card validation
The credit card validation can be found in ```js/app.js > $scope.validateCard```

Feedback is highly appreciated.
